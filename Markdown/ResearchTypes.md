`Research paper`, `Review Paper`, `Survey paper`, `case Study`.  

`Research Paper`: We introduce new knowledge or insights in research paper. 

`Review Paper`: We summarize and synthesize related literature to find new trends, research gap.

`Survey paper`: We prepare a survey, collect data, analysis the data to discover trends, correlation. It provides us data driven insights.

`Case Study`: It provides a detailed and in-depth analysis of a particular case to uncover insights or trends.
