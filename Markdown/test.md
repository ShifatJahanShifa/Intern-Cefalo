  The W3C Working Draft was submitted in 2006. It was named as CORS in 2009. Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows web pages to access resources from a different domain while bypassing the same-origin policy safely. Using CORS, we are now able to read the resources of other domains if we are allowed to read it. Basically, the server explicitly allows cross-origin requests by including specific HTTP headers in its response.

    The mechanism classifies three different categories of subresource access:

    Cross-origin writes
    Cross-origin embeds
    Cross-origin reads
