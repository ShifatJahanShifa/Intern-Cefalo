# WebSockets API

In `Websocket api`, the client establishes persistent, bi-directional communication channel between server and client. In HTTP, for new data, we need to repeatedly requests the server for that. But using websocket api we can achieve real time communication.

## How WebSockets Work?
1. Client initiates a WebSocket connection using ws:// or wss:// (secure WebSocket).
2. The server accepts the connection and keeps it open.
3. Both the client and server can send messages to each other anytimeâ€”without needing to wait for a request.
4. The connection remains open until either side closes it.
