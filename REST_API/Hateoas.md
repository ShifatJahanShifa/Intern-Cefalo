# HATEOAS 

**HATEOAS** - Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State. It is one of the six constraints of the REST software architectural style. It is an essential part for `Uniform interface` feature of REST.  

To understand HATEOAS, we need to understand what it is meant by `Hypermedia`. As the `<a>..</a>` element links the different documents to make a website, in the similar way **hypermedia** links different parts of an **API**. 

In each response to a request, we can discover all the possible follow-up requests we can make based on the application state. Hence, it is the `engine of application state`. 


> Note: covered the WHAT part. Still need to cover the WHY, HOW part.
